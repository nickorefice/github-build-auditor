# GitHub Actions Docker Build Time Tracker

This project tracks the duration of Docker build steps in GitHub Actions workflows for a user's repositories.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- GitHub Personal Access Token with fine-grained permissions

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/github-actions-docker-build-time-tracker.git
    cd github-actions-docker-build-time-tracker
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Create a [`.env`](.env ) file in the root directory and add your GitHub token:

    ```properties
    GITHUB_TOKEN=your_generated_token_here
    ```

## Creating a GitHub Personal Access Token

1. **Log in to GitHub**:
   - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and log in to your account.

2. **Navigate to Settings**:
   - Click on your profile picture in the upper-right corner.
   - Select "Settings" from the dropdown menu.

3. **Access Developer Settings**:
   - In the left sidebar, scroll down and click on "Developer settings".

4. **Personal Access Tokens**:
   - Click on "Personal access tokens" in the left sidebar.
   - Click on "Tokens (fine-grained)" if you are using the fine-grained token interface.

5. **Generate New Token**:
   - Click the "Generate new token" button.
   - Give your token a descriptive name in the "Note" field.

6. **Select Repository Access**:
   - Choose the repositories you want to grant access to or select "All repositories" if you want to access all repositories.

7. **Set Permissions**:
   - Under "Repository permissions", set the following:
     - **Contents**: `Read-only` (to access repository contents)
     - **Metadata**: `Read-only` (to access repository metadata)
     - **Actions**: `Read-only` (to access workflow runs and jobs)

8. **Generate Token**:
   - Scroll down and click the "Generate token" button.

9. **Copy the Token**:
   - Copy the generated token and store it in a safe place. You won't be able to see it again once you leave the page.

10. **Add Token to .env File**:
    - Open your [.env](http://_vscodecontentref_/0) file and add the token:

      ```properties
      GITHUB_TOKEN=your_generated_token_here
      GITHUB_USERNAME=your_github_username_here
      ```

### Why Each Permission is Needed

- **Contents (Read-only)**: This permission allows the script to read the contents of the repositories. It is necessary to access the workflows and their configurations stored in the repository.
- **Metadata (Read-only)**: This permission allows the script to read metadata about the repositories. It is necessary to list the repositories and retrieve basic information about them, such as their names and IDs.
- **Actions (Read-only)**: This permission allows the script to read information about GitHub Actions workflows, workflow runs, and jobs. It is necessary to:
  - List workflows in a repository.
  - Retrieve workflow runs for a specific workflow.
  - Retrieve jobs and steps within a workflow run to analyze the Docker build times.

## Usage

Run the CLI tool to track Docker build times:

```sh
python src/docker_build_time.py
